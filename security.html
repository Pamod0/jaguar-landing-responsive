            The private security field has seen the entry of several players
            over the years, with low service quality and employee exploitation
            proliferating the industry. The majority of service providers in the
            industry take advantage of the low entry barriers and employee
            vulnerability to pay low salaries and offer poor service quality at
            a cheap price. Competing in this environment requires the
            organisation to have a clear vision of the value proposition offered
            to its Clients.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-1 mb-30">
            We at Jaguar have prided ourselves on the value proposition offered
            to our clients. We cater to a demanding clientele that identifies
            with our core values, and we consistently provide more for less. Our
            service quality is excellent and our prices reasonable. Our
            employees are the best paid in the industry, and we will work to
            maintain this advantage. As a result we do not suffer the general
            malaise of cadre shortage in the industry. With adequate numbers to
            service our Clients, we can better focus on service delivery. The
            sum total of this value proposition is a risk free superior service.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-1 mb-30">
            We attract and retain the required number of quality security
            officers for all our units, which ensures we are able to provide all
            our clients with uninterrupted services at all times. We take pride
            in putting our employees first, ensuring a contended workforce that
            can meet and exceed our client’s requirements.

            We understand our client’s requirements and ensure those
            requirements are met to satisfaction. We give priority to
            communicating with our clients, using specifically designed tools to
            convey the required information. We develop the Unit Standing Orders
            in consultation with the client organisation and reference this
            document into our Security Service Agreement, ensuring commitment
            and follow-up. We review and update the Unit Standing Orders on a
            regular basis and train on this document to ensure standard
            operating procedures are followed by everyone. We are readily
            available to our clients, from the line manager or Visiting Officer
            to our Chairman/Managing Director. This ensures that client
            requirements are quickly dissipated to the operational staff.

          <p class="paragraph-1 mb-30 highlighted">
            Our competitive advantage is our management and supervision.
            Security officers in most reliable security companies perform a
            similar service at a similar quality level, while smaller and less
            focused companies perform at a lower quality level. Our officers are
            able to perform at a higher level of service quality due to the
            hands-on involvement of the working directors and senior
            management..
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-1 mb-30">
            We are strong in the management and supervision of our security
            operation, to ensure that we meet our commitments at all times. Our
            security operations are conducted in teams, headed by the General
            Manager and the Security Manager, with an Area Manager / Visiting
            Officer, assigned to each unit. All teams come directly under the
            Managing Director and the Executive Director. In addition, the
            Security Manager works closely to plan and monitor the operation,
            while the Training Manager works with the line managers to ensure
            on-site training and development of the cadre and review of
            operational procedures. This will ensure that the entire management
            team will become well versed in the security requirements of the
            unit, and we will be able to work closely with the cadre deployed at
            the unit. The Directors are personally involved in planning,
            organising, staffing, and controlling operations, as well as HRM and
            Client Relationship Management. This ensures that security officers
            and Customers are always in direct contact with the Directors and
            senior management at all times.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-1 mb-30">
            We pay extra attention to ground operations, with emphasis on
            supervision and unit training, ensuring that management visits are
            carried out almost daily, at all units, day and night. Area Managers
            and Visiting Officers are trained to continuously assess employee
            performance and Customer requirements, through these regular visits.
            Regular Client meetings are organised where Client concerns are
            addressed; a systematic method of documentation and reporting of all
            incidents, instructions, and deployment variations is maintained;
            unit standing orders are prepared, reviewed and issued in
            consultation with the Client, detailing the duties and obligations
            of each and every officer deployed; and regular training is
            conducted to ensure that deployed officers are well versed in their
            respective standing orders, to ensure that our security service
            meets and exceeds customer expectations. Coupled with the close
            communication the directors and management maintain with our
            Clients, we are able to guarantee customer satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-1 mb-30">
            All our security officers are individually vetted and personally
            interviewed by the directors prior to recruitment. On recruitment,
            all personnel are provided with basic training, including on-the-job
            training with other security officers. Our employees are guaranteed
            maximum wages for the stipulated duty, while employee welfare and
            wellbeing remain a top priority. We recognise our employees as our
            only asset, and we are also aware that they are our best Customer
            Relationship Managers.
